[{"categories":null,"content":"My nameâ€™s Tyler ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m currently working as a Principal Analytics Engineer at Hubspot, focusing on corporate reporting related to the comapanyâ€™s financial data. Most recently, I worked as a senior data engineer at Joyn Insurance, where I was the one of two members of the data organization. While there, I completely re-designed and modernized Joynâ€™s data ecosystem and platform. Further, I automated away dozens of human-hours weekly and better ensured compliance by implementing several reverse ELT processes from Joynâ€™s data warehouse to clients, vendors, and regulatory reporting agencies. I also increased the maturity of Joynâ€™s software development processes, introducing better CI/CD practices, documentation, and testing across the organization. In 2021, I started working as a data scientist, data product manager, and data engineer at Cerebral. In these positions, I both managed and implemented Cerebralâ€™s data products arm, which included projects such as an embedded Clinicial Decision Support tool to provide clinical guidence to clinicians as well as an NLP model trained to detect mental crisis messages from patients coming in via the support chat (which led to average response times of less than 10 minutes rather than over 12 hours for the normal support messages). Additionally, I created and led the data quality initiatives for the team, including a twice-quarterly day-long hackathon to address gaps in infrastructure and best practices across the data ecosystem. Before that, I worked as a data scientist and software developer at Epic Systems, focusing on predictive models for clinical and operational usage in Epicâ€™s EMR as well as epidemiological and utilization research into COVID-19 patient populations to inform health system behavior. I did my Ph.D. at Princetonâ€™s Lewis Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics in Mike Levineâ€™s lab, working on developmental biology questions largely using microscopy and transcriptomic data. While my previous background resolves largely around healthcare and microscopy data, I am always interested in gaining expertise in new domains. I have a passion for enabling data-driven decision-making, data quality, reproducible research, and scientific communication.
